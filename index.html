<p>This is a simulation of the basic demographic / genealogical process. Individuals are born and
    individuals die. This causes lineages to branch and to disappear, and causes the population to share a
    common ancestor at some time in the past. The <em>coalescent</em> provides a mathematical description of
    these patterns of ancestry.</p>

<p>Individuals are represented as circles. Layout is taken care of through simple physics. Each individual
    is given a charge and Coulomb's law is used to for repulsion. The edges of the screen are also
    charged.</p>

<p>Individuals leave a trace of where they used to be. I was pleasantly surprised to have the physical
    location of a lineage cleanly reveal its genealogical history.</p>
