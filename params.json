Individuals are born and individuals die. This causes lineages to branch and to disappear, and causes the population to share a common ancestor at some time in the past. The coalescent provides a mathematical description of these patterns of ancestry.\r\n\r\nIndividuals are represented as circles. Layout is taken care of through simple physics. Each individual is given a charge and Coulomb's law is used to for repulsion. The edges of the screen are also charged.\r\n\r\nIndividuals leave a trace of where they used to be. I was pleasantly surprised to have the physical location of a lineage cleanly reveal its genealogical history.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
